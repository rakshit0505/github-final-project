## 📖 Formula
Simple Interest is calculated as:

\[
SI = P \times T \times R
\]

Where:  
- **P** = Principal Amount  
- **T** = Time (in years)  
- **R** = Annual Rate of Interest (in decimal or percentage form)

## 🖥️ Example
```text
Input:
   P = 1000
   T = 2 years
   R = 5% (0.05)

Output:
   Simple Interest = 100.0
